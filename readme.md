# Introduction

PBI Stories is a Power BI custom visual that allows you to include instagram-like stories to your dashboards. It's very useful as a "What's New" visual or to highlight important insights in a slideshow format. It supports both image and video formats.

This custom visual is a wrapper of [react-insta-stories](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-insta-stories). Props to [mohitk05](https://github.com/mohitk05) for building this awesome library.

# How to install

You just download the "PBIStoriesA2CC...".pbiviz file from the dist folder and import it by pressing "Import visual from a file" in your PBIX file.
